Use ring buffer. Write at constant "speed" but read faster or slower
than
you write. If you read faster pitch goes up and if you read slower pitch
goes down. Sound quality is pretty horrible due to the phase
discontinuities (i.e. phases don't match when read and write passes each
other) but it works. The length of the ring buffer is crucial parameter for
satisfactory results.
